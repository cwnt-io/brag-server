# implement_makefile_and_deploy_steps (Issue)

- [x] learn make? make file?
  - [ ] deploy with make: try to make as automatic as possible
    - check if asdf is already installed install_asdf
      - same for rust and pyhton
    - load_db and brag-server: compile, cp binaries to .local/bin, and run them there
- [x] migrate asdf to script
  - ignore .tool-versions
